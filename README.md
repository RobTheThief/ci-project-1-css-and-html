### Known Bugs

- There are currently no known bugs.  However many were found and squashed along the way. Here are some examples;
    - Positioning the hamburger icon gave different results in Chrome vs Firefox using positioning relative to the parent element. So to resolve this I used absolute positioning to get the same result on both browsers.
    - The placeholder text in the textarea element in the contact form would not show. After researching the problem came up with no answers, I found that I had returned the closing tag to the next line to keep my code tidy and but this had entered some blank spaces and tabs to the input, negating the placeholder until deleted.


### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave Browser, Ecosia and Safari.
